When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It helps keeping your work in a remote repository so that you can view it anywhere and anytime if you just have an internet connection. You need not be dependent on your machine to work on those. Also, it helps other people who wants to view your work, review it and then edit it. GitHub is a great tool.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There may be scenarios where I do not want to pull my changes to local, or there may be someone else who is working on my remote which I do not want on my local, etc. Also, if Git automatically tries to stay up-to-date with my remote, there may be merge issues which Git might not know how to resolve. A manual sync is always better than an automatic one.
